# Building with Active Record: Micro Reddit
 
> We create a Ruby on Rails application, using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides. This means, build a form the old-fashioned way and then the Rails way.
We create: methods, models, routes, and views for "new" and "edit", allowing create new users and update edited information.

- Consists of one models: User, two views: new, edit, 4 methods new, create, edit, and update, and one route for users that allow us to use  previews methods.
- A user is allowed to create a username, with email and password, and if wants can modify the values in the futere..
