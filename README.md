# Building a Form with Ruby on Rails
 
> We create a Ruby on Rails application, first using nearly-pure HTML and then the helper methods that Rails provides.
We create: methods, models, routes, and views for "new" and "edit", allowing to create new users and update their information.

- Consists of one model: User, two views: new, and edit, 4 methods: new, create, edit, and update, and one route for users that allow us to use previews methods.
- A user is allowed to create a new user with a username, email, and password, and to modify the saved data in the future.
- Works on the browser.

## Built With
- Ruby (v. 2.7.2)
- Ruby on Rails (v. 6.1.1)
- Rubocop
- Git
 
## Setup
- Run 'bundle install'
 
## How to run it
